He picked\n          up the guitar at age 14 and never put it down. Kris has always had a\n          penchant for crafting words together, and this eventually developed\n          into a deep love for songwriting. His songs and stories (often\n          autobiographical) are about love and love lost, life and death, and\n          everything in between. He is currently recording a collection of songs\n          that he has written over the past few years as a solo artist.
